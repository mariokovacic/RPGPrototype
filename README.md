# RPGPrototype
This is my first RPG CARD GAME ever, it is not finished and it never will be. It's purpose was to practice DOM manipulation and practicing the JavaScript syntax. This game/code is a skeleton of "can be a game", it is not playable because there is only basic attack included plus-minus few options./buttons more. And most important, there is no story.
