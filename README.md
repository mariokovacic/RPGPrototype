# RPGPrototype

Here I learned aswell why we DO NOT use Vanilla JavaScript to make Single page web apps!(Spaghetti code) :) but we use frameworks...(React etc)....


This is my first RPG CARD GAME ever, it is not finished and it never will be. It's purpose was to practice DOM manipulation and practicing the JavaScript syntax. This game/code is a skeleton of "can be a game", it is not playable because there is only basic attack included plus-minus few options/buttons more. And most important, there is no story.

And it's bugged all over the place. :)
